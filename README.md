Travel Tracker for CS 345

This is a readme. As the title suggests, you should read me.

## Database Notes
The database is written in SQLite, any queries to that database should be done using Java's documentation on incorporating SQLite.
If there are any issues accessing the database check the documentation on Xerial/JDBC. https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc
If you're running into an issue where they can't find the JDBC class, you simply have to go to this link: https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/releases
and download the "sqlite-jdbc-3.32.3.2.jar". Once you have this jar library file you need to add it to your project through your IDE's method of adding jar
files.
